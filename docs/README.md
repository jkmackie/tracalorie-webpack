# Tracalorie App 1.0.0

The Tracalorie app tracks calories against the calorie limit.  The project is from the [Modern JavaScript from The Beginning 2.0 course](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0).

Building the app, using the ```npm run build``` command, generates production-ready files in dist folder.  It is bundled using the [**webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/) module bundler for JavaScript.

The Netlify host automatically builds and deploys changes to this repo (build doesn't need to be manually run).

**NEW:** An Edit button is available!  Item or calories can be updated using it.
